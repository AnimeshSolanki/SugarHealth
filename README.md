# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository hosts an innovative Diabetes Prediction Model designed to empower individuals with timely insights into their health status. Employing machine learning, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm, this model scrutinizes essential health indicators to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

## Data Source

The model is trained on a dataset with the following columns: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, and Outcome. Each column contributes crucial information to the prediction process, facilitating accurate and informed health assessments.

## Model Development

The Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm was utilized to construct a robust predictive model. Renowned for its proficiency in capturing intricate relationships within datasets, SVM ensures precise predictions concerning the presence or absence of diabetes. Rigorous testing and optimization were undertaken to augment the model's predictive capabilities.

## Usage

1. **Data Input:**
   Users can input pertinent health data in a format akin to the provided dataset. The model processes this information to generate predictions based on established patterns.

2. **Decision Trees Classification:**
   The model relies on the Support Vector Machine algorithm for classification, allowing it to navigate through various health indicators and make informed predictions about diabetes risk.

3. **Web Interface:**
   To enhance user accessibility, an interactive website was crafted using HTML and CSS. This web interface enables users to seamlessly interact with the model, input their health data, and receive real-time predictions. The user-friendly design ensures a smooth experience for individuals of all technical backgrounds.
