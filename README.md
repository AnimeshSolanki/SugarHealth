# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview

This repository houses an innovative Diabetes Prediction Model designed to empower individuals with timely insights into their health status. Leveraging machine learning, particularly the Decision Trees classification algorithm, this model analyzes key health indicators to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

## Data Source

The model is trained on a dataset with the following columns: Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age, and Outcome. Each column contributes crucial information to the prediction process, enabling accurate and informed health assessments.

## Model Development

The Decision Trees classification algorithm was employed to build a robust predictive model. This algorithm excels in capturing complex relationships within the dataset, ensuring accurate predictions regarding the presence or absence of diabetes. Rigorous testing and optimization were conducted to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.

## Usage

1. **Data Input:**
   Users can input relevant health data in a format similar to the provided dataset. The model processes this information to generate predictions based on established patterns.

2. **Decision Trees Classification:**
   The heart of the model lies in its utilization of Decision Trees for classification. This methodology allows the algorithm to navigate through various health indicators and make informed predictions regarding diabetes risk.

3. **Web Interface:**
   To enhance user accessibility, an interactive website was developed using HTML and CSS. This web interface allows users to seamlessly interact with the model, input their health data, and receive real-time predictions. The user-friendly design ensures a smooth experience for individuals of all technical backgrounds.
